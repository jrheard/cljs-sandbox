ok, let's try doing a little perf demo/test to see how svg+reagent stuff works

ok uh let's try doing just a few squares that bounce around the screen

drawing pretty squares was pretty easy, haven't started making them bounce yet

the performance on animating these squares hasn't been completely great - time to
add some console.logs to see if we're redrawing every square whenever one of them moves

quick braindump
i want to understand why the mortgage UI has such bad performance, seems like the entire graph
is redrawn whenever a bar is highlighted
things i plan to do related to this problem:
* read reagent source code
* read react source code / API
* get rid of mouseover/mouseout event handlers in mortgage demo, see if performance/behavior is at all affected;
  just have some anonymous go-block toggle a bar selected/unselected every 2 seconds or whatever
* for curiosity's sake, build a demo (partially implemented atm) in cljs-sandbox that tests framerate of a bunch
  of moving squares bouncing around the screen
* implement some way of detecting+displaying framerate, per above

(mainly interested in performance of svg to see if i can use it for boi, and also just out of curiosity at this point)
